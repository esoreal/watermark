# üî• Documenting

First of all when using it make sure to put the module at line 1 where everything start's.

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esoreal/watermark/main/source.lua'))()
```
The loadstring loads the module.

To load the watermark module you'll have to load a function

```lua
WatermarkLibrary:Load()
```

This set's up the watermark module and needs to be documented to begin.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Using it

To use this watermark module theres a simple argument (That's what i like to call it.) to use it.

```lua
CreateWatermark(string, value)
```

Please do mention that you can use custom symbols such as

```lua
local con = "/"
local plus = "+"
```

To change the color you may set up a function to change the value of the color as it settted up with Color3.new(color;)

```lua
function Color()
   Accent.Color = Color3.fromRGB(colorRGB) --// changing the color
end
```

To change the position that's pretty much the same.

```lua
function Pos()
   WatermarkFrame.Position = Vector;
end
```

That's pretty much it!
