First of all when using it make sure to put the module at line 1 where everything start's.

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esoreal/watermark/main/source.lua'))()
```
The loadstring loads the module.

To load the watermark module you'll have to load a function

```lua
WatermarkLibrary:Load()
```

This set's up the watermark module and needs to be documented to begin.
